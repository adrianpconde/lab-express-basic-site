    <h1>About The Mandalorian</h1>
    <div class="info">
      <p>
        The Mandalorian is a bounty hunter who was active during the early years
        of the New Republic Era. <br />
        Orphaned as a child when Separatist battle droids killed his parents, he
        was taken in by the Mandalorians and raised as a "found", orphan from
        another planet adopted and raised in their own culture, eventually
        becoming a member of a reclusive sect of Mandalorians, known as "the
        Tribe". <br />
        Due to his childhood trauma, the Mandalorian developed a notable hatred
        for droids. According to the tenets of the Tribe's Mandalorian Creed,
        the Mandalorian does not remove his helmet in the presence of others.
        <br />
        Over time, the Mandalorian became a member of the Bounty Hunters' Guild
        on Nevarro, developing a reputation of being an expensive but formidable
        bounty hunter. <br />

          id="about-img"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        Originally hired to capture Grogu, a light-green, Force-sensitive infant
        of the same species as Yoda –the well known character who appears on
        <i>Star Wars</i> franchise, from Episode I to Episode IV–, the
        Mandalorian instead protects him from a remnant of the fallen Galactic
        Empire, and becomes a father figure for him. <br />
        The dynamic between the Mandalorian and Grogu embodies a theme of
        parenting and fatherhood prevalent throughout the TV series.
